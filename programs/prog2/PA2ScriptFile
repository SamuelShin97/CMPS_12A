/**
 * This program was completed using pair programming by me
 * Samuel Shin and my partner Jessy Rakesh Armstrong.
 * I acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should "drive"
 * roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and at most 25%
 * of an individual's effort for an assignment should be spent working
 * alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer must be reviewed by the
 * partner. The object is to work together, learning from each other, not
 * to divide the work into two pieces with each partner working on a
 * different piece.
 * I spent 1______ HOURS working alone.
 * I spent 3______ HOURS working with my partner on this assignment.
 * I estimate that of the time spent with my partner, I "drove" 50_____
 * PERCENT of the time. 
 *
 * Put any comment or explanation about variations from the 
 * expected pair programming practice here. E.g. if you didn't complete
 * the assignment with your partner, this is the place to explain why
 * not. 
 * Some of the code in the method "wordToHash" was taken from professor Bailey's
 * lecture to create the hash table.
 *
 * Assignment #2
 * This program takes in a string inputed by the user and goes through the 
 * word list checking for anagrams of the inputed string and prints them out.
 * 
 * Authors: Samuel Shin (sayshin@ucsc.edu)
